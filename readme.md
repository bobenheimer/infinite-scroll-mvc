Inspired by [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) Virtual Scroll MVC is a comparison of javascript frameworks
implementing "virtual scrolling".  Virtual scrolling differs from [infinite scrolling](http://xkcd.com/1309/)
because it appears to the user like a normal list of items with a normal scrollbar except that not all of those elements are in the DOM -
as the user scrolls, elements remove and are added to the DOM.  This gives significant performance increases on large lists of items.
